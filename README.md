Brain tumor detection on MRI images using CNN

# Dataset
Dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

# Implementation
Augmentation of dataset 
what is image augmentation? 
In brief, image augmentation means you apply randomized alterations to your data, thereby increasing the amount of variability in the dataset.

Since the dataset is small, with the help of data augmentation technique we are able to increase the number of examples.

# Tumor detection
CNN is applied on the augmented data to identify if tumor is present or not
